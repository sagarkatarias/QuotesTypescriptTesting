# Coding Challenge

## Create an interface for presenting Quotes

1. The interface should match the mock provided (do not worry about being extremely precise with the spacing).

2. Users should be able to favorite/unfavorite Quotes

   1. Favorited Icon: 😍
   2. Not Favorited Icon: 🫥 or 😶 or 🙂

3. Users should be able to clear all favorited Quotes

4. Quotes should always be sorted by their unique ID

## Stretch Goals

5. Tests should be implemented for all components

6. TypeScript should be leveraged as much as possible

## Design Mocks
